It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?

You know what this means. 15 minutes for the lone server to take a drink order. 15 minutes for the drink to arrive. another 30 minutes to order food. another hour before the food arrives. And when we ask for the bill, another 20 minutes for that to arrive. The poor server, whose fault this is not, was running around like crazy. Management needs to get their act together. While I realize this was a large group, there was at least one other server that had much less to do in another section.

I informed the woman about the previous mistakes, she said we should have called them that day. Okay, fair enough...\\n\\nThe delivery took over an hour.

Mind you,  the children had been waiting over an hour to eat, so they had already taken a couple of slices from the pizza... the woman said the chef said the bread was fine. Really?  Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!! She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED &amp; IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order. \\n\\nI said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.\\n\\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY.</td>\n",
